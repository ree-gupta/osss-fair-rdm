# FAIR Research Data Management Workshop

A hands-on, actionable workshop for researchers on implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in research data management.

## Overview

This 105-minute interactive workshop helps researchers bridge the gap between knowing they should share data and feeling confident to actually do it. Participants learn practical skills for organizing, documenting, and sharing research data while understanding which aspects of FAIR data management are their responsibility versus what's handled by tools.

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this session, participants will:

- Have practical skills for organizing, documenting, and sharing data
- Know how to find and adopt standards their field already uses
- Walk away with one concrete next step to take within the next month
