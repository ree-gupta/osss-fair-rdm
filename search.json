So, I hope that Felix has sufficiently inspired you to share your data and implement the FAIR principles. In this session, we will try translating that good intention into actual practice. This might feel daunting, but that’s completely understandable.\nIn the next 105 minutes, we’ll bridge that gap together. You’ll leave with concrete decisions made and practical tools you can use starting tomorrow. This workshop isn’t about achieving perfection in your research data management practices but identifying where you can improve and take clear, manageable first steps that will transform how you handle data."

I want everyone to feel comfortable participating at their own level. You can use whatever name you’re comfortable with - your real name, an alias, or just observe without contributing. For the worksheets, I’ll provide a shared document where you can collaborate, but you’re also welcome to take your own private notes. The goal is learning, not performance."

The gap between inspiring open science talks and your daily reality can feel overwhelming. You’re already stretched thin managing your actual research and the idea of organizing everything for others can feel impossible.\nAs I said, we’re going to bridge that gap together with concrete, manageable steps.

Please go to the Particify link on the screen. Did you recognize yourself in at least one of those scenarios? Did it make you a tiny bit anxious about your own data practices? Okay, it looks like we’re not alone in this. This shared anxiety is exactly why we’re here today.”\n\n\n\nNow, let’s move from feeling to diagnosis. On Particify, I want you to name the preventable failures you saw. What were the root causes? Think ‘no documentation,’ ‘broken link,’ ‘permission unclear.’ Just one or two words per entry. Take two minutes to capture the patterns you noticed.\nI was hoping that you would identify these patterns like you did, documentation gaps, access problems, format issues, legal/permission confusion, and discoverability failures. These aren’t unique problems; they are predictable challenges. And with your own experience, you just diagnosed the exact problems the FAIR principles were designed to solve."

These problems are so universal that in 2014, researchers from fields as different as astronomy, biology, and social science met and realized they were all struggling with identical fundamental issues.\nI think it’s important to know that FAIR principles weren’t created by administrators, librarians, or IT departments trying to impose more requirements on researchers. They were developed by working researchers who were frustrated with losing data, time, and opportunities due to these recurring problems.\nThe 2014 workshop in Leiden brought together physicists, biologists, social scientists, and researchers from many other fields, all saying essentially the same thing: “These data management problems are seriously hurting our productivity and the impact of our research.” The principles they published in 2016 have become widely adopted precisely because they work, they solve real problems that researchers actually experience every day.\nThe reason we need this now more than ever? The scale of research data is exploding, collaboration is increasingly global, and the cost of lost or unusable data keeps growing. Plus, if you’re applying for grants or publishing in major journals, you’re already being asked about FAIR compliance. The question isn’t whether you’ll encounter FAIR, it’s whether you’ll be ready when you do.\n\nWilkinson et al. (2016). The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship.

It is because they define principles, not another set of rigid standards.\nA standard says ‘use this specific metadata format.’ A principle says ‘make your data findable.’ A standard says ‘store in repository X.’ A principle says ‘make it accessible.’ See the difference?\nThis matters because your sensitive human subjects data needs a completely different approach than someone’s computational models. FAIR doesn’t force you into a one-size-fits-all solution. It gives you the goals, findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable and lets you figure out the best way to get there given your constraints.\nThat’s why it works across every field represented in this room."

Every stage you see here represents a choice point where you can either prevent problems or create them. The researchers in that video didn’t fail because they were careless—they failed because they didn’t have systematic prevention built into their workflow.\nLook at the planning stage: this is where you make foundational decisions, how will you name files consistently? Where will you store data? What backup systems will you use? During collection, you’re documenting what each measurement means as you go, not trying to decipher cryptic abbreviations months later. In analysis, you’re keeping track of every step and decision, not hoping you’ll remember your process when someone asks about it.\nBy the time you reach sharing, you’re not scrambling to figure out permissions or hunting for missing pieces. You’re publishing work that was designed from the start to be understood and used by others.\nThis systematic thinking through each stage is exactly what a document called “Data Management Plan” captures and guides you through."

By the end of today, you’ll have chosen a repository for your data type, identified relevant standards for your field, and selected an appropriate license—all using decision tools and community resources we’ll explore together.\nWednesday’s workshop will then help you consolidate these decisions into a polished, funder-ready DMP.

DOI: 10.3389/fninf.2014.00032\nSpeaker Notes: So many varied answers in that poll, right? ‘Context,’ ‘documentation,’ ‘data about data,’ ‘labels.’ This variety is exactly why metadata feels like a moving target with different significance in different contexts. Even when you’re aware of FAIR principles, metadata can feel overwhelming and abstract.\nThis figure tries to categorize metadata in a way that makes most sense to you as researchers. At the top, ‘Proper Metadata’ - that’s the catalog information that repositories need. It’s probably what librarians and data engineers mean when they talk about metadata. On the left—‘Soft Metadata’—the human context about why your research matters. In the middle—‘Hard Metadata’—the technical specifications someone needs to replicate your work. On the right—‘Data Complement’—the structural description of your recorded data itself.\nAnd you don’t need to tackle all of this at once. The lifecycle approach we just saw tells you when to focus on what. With the FAIR aware research data cycle, you would build up metadata systematically as you move through your research process—soft metadata during planning, hard metadata during collection and analysis, data complement as you organize files, and proper metadata when you’re ready to share.\nThese different levels work differently to support the FAIR principles. We’ll keep referring back to this framework throughout the workshop so you know exactly what to focus on at each stage, making metadata feel concrete and manageable instead of overwhelming."

This is the deep-level IT stuff, like server protocols. And the parts in blue are Social decisions. These are the agreements and choices that you, your lab, or your entire research community make. Here’s the key takeaway I want you to remember: You do not have to build this entire system yourself. Let’s start with what you can safely ignore. The red parts - the technical infrastructure - that’s the job of your repository. When you upload your data to a platform like Zenodo, Figshare, or a specialized institutional repository, they handle the standardized protocols. So, you can cross that off your worry list. Now, let’s talk about the orange bits. This is where I see most researchers get stuck. They see ‘vocabularies’, ‘community standards’, ‘formal language’ and think, ‘Do I have to invent one of these?’ The answer is an emphatic NO. Your job is not to create these standards. Your job is to choose one. Think of it like citing a paper. You don’t invent a new citation style every time you write; you choose an existing one like APA or MLA. It’s the same here. So, the big message for everything you see in orange is: Don’t invent, adopt. Choose the tools and standards your community already values. This single decision will take care of most of the interoperability and reusability principles. Okay, so if the repository handles the red stuff, and you just need to choose the orange stuff, where should you focus your energy? You should focus your energy right here, on the blue parts and on using those orange standards to create great metadata. The blue parts are the ‘Social Decisions’. These are the key choices where you, the researcher, have the most control and responsibility\nALTERNATIVE\nFirst, look at everything highlighted in light red. This is the Technical Infrastructure.\nThink of things like globally unique and persistent identifiers, standardized communication protocols, and authentication. This is the deep-level IT stuff—the plumbing of the internet that makes data sharing possible.\nThis is not your job.\nWhen you choose a good data repository—like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or your own institutional repository—they handle all of this for you. They create the persistent identifiers, they manage the servers, and they use the standard protocols. So, you can mentally check off all the red parts. That’s the repository’s responsibility.\nNext, let’s look at the orange parts. This is where I see most researchers get stuck. They see phrases like formal, accessible, shared language and vocabularies that follow FAIR principles, and they panic, thinking, ‘Do I have to invent a new language for my data?’\nThe answer is an emphatic NO.\nYour job is not to create these standards. Your job is to choose and adopt the ones your research community already uses and values.\nThink of it like citing a paper. You don’t invent a new citation style every time you write a manuscript; you choose an existing one like APA, MLA, or Vancouver. It’s the same principle here. For describing a variable, a method, or a sample, you find and use the established vocabulary or format for your field.\nSo, the big message for everything you see in orange is: Don’t invent, adopt. This single decision to use community standards will take care of most of the ‘Interoperability’ and ‘Reusability’ principles for you.\nSo, if the repository handles the red stuff, and you just adopt the orange stuff, where should you focus your energy?\nYou should focus your energy right here, on the blue parts—the Social Decisions—and on using those orange standards to create rich, machine-readable metadata.\nThis is where you, the subject matter expert, are irreplaceable. This is your core contribution to making your data FAIR.\nLet’s connect this to the diagram on the slide. Your job is to tell the story of your data. And tell it in a way that not just humans but machines can also understand it, that is, again machine readable metadata, that is the hard and soft metadata from the framework before.\nAs for the “Proper Metadata”, make sure you record it well and make available completely when needed by your data sharing platform of choice.\nIn addition, The blue items on the FAIR list are the practical decisions you make to capture this story:\nChoosing a clear and accessible data usage license (R1.1).\nDescribing the data’s origin and history, or provenance (R1.2). This includes maintaining the data and metadata as a living object, updating it and not abandoning it.\nThis is your focus: using the tools and standards your community provides to accurately and thoroughly describe your science, so that both a person and a computer can understand not just what the data is, but how and why it came to be."

Let’s walk through the key ones on the slide.\nAvoiding spaces and special characters prevents headaches when files need to work across different systems—what looks fine on your Mac might break on a colleague’s Windows machine or a computing cluster. The 32-character limit keeps filenames readable and prevents truncation issues. Keeping folder structures reasonably flat makes navigation easier, especially as projects grow. Using standardized formats like YYYY-MM-DD for dates ensures files sort chronologically, and zero-padding numbers does the same for sequences.\nThe bigger picture here is consistency. When you establish predictable patterns, you’re not just helping future you find files—you’re making it possible for software to automatically organize and process your work. Think of it like creating a filing system that both humans and computers can follow.\nTwo practical benchmarks to keep in mind: if you can’t find a specific file in 30 seconds, your naming system needs work. And if a computer couldn’t follow your organizational pattern to automatically work through your files, you’re creating unnecessary future work for yourself and your team."

Without a clear versioning strategy, you end up with folders full of files that track every iteration, making it hard to know which version is current or how you got there.\nThe simplest approach is systematic version numbers: data_v1.csv, data_v2.csv, and so on. Pair this with a changelog file that explains what changed in each version—it takes two minutes to write but saves hours of detective work later when you’re trying to remember why you made certain changes.\nTo make this easier, version control tools like Git can automate much of this tracking. Git handles the technical details of storing changes and lets you easily compare versions or roll back when needed. There’s actually a dedicated Git session later in this workshop where you’ll see how it works in practice for research workflows."

Can researchers identify who created this and their background? Do they understand what’s actually in your data files? Can they tell if the time period and location fit their needs? Do they grasp why you created this dataset and how it connects to your research?\nRepositories guide you through this process with forms that prompt you for the right information. But the strategic thinking, choosing keywords that your community actually uses, writing titles that clearly communicate your contribution, that’s where your expertise matters most.\nFor instance, a title like “Study 1 Data” tells potential users nothing about who, what, when, where, why, or how of the dataset. Keywords that match how your community actually talks about this research area—that’s what connects your work to the people who need it.\nThink about your own search behavior. When you’re looking for existing datasets, what information helps you quickly decide if something is relevant? You want to know who created it, what’s in it, when it was made, where it came from, why it exists, and how to use it. Apply that same logic to how you describe your own work.\nTo think about this, you would go to your field’s main repository or search engine, search for the kind of research you’ve done, and see if your dataset would actually show up in those results.

Before BIDS, sharing brain imaging data was a nightmare. Different labs had their own folder structures, file naming conventions, and metadata practices. This made it nearly impossible to reuse data without extensive manual reorganization. The data that came out of the scanner looked like something on the left, which made sense for the that specific equpiment but was not intuitive for reuse. On the right, you see how BIDS organizes the same data in a clear, consistent way.\nAnd what this meant in practice is that researchers who adopted BIDS could share their data, and others could immediately use it with existing analysis tools. This dramatically lowered the barrier to data reuse, leading to more collaborative research and faster scientific progress. BIDS didn’t just standardize file organization; it created an ecosystem where tools, repositories, and researchers all spoke the same language. This is the kind of impact organizational standards can have when widely adopted."

You search for “model” and get everything from runway fashion to airplane prototypes.\nShared vocabularies solve this by providing precise, agreed-upon terms. Instead of “model,” you’d search for “linear regression model” or “Alzheimer disease model mouse” - terms that have specific definitions your research community understands.\nWikidata works across disciplines as a multilingual knowledge base. NCBI BioPortal is your gateway to hundreds of biomedical ontologies - it’s like a one-stop shop for finding the right vocabulary for your field. If you’re working with organisms, NCBI Taxonomy gives you standardized species names. For chemical compounds, ChEBI provides precise molecular identifiers.\nThe key insight: you don’t need to create these vocabularies - they already exist. Gene Ontology has been developed by molecular biologists for decades. MeSH terms are used by every major medical database. EDAM covers bioinformatics tools and data types comprehensively.\nThis isn’t just about better search results. When everyone uses the same controlled vocabulary, computers can automatically find related datasets, combine data appropriately, and enable meta-analyses that would be impossible otherwise. Your data becomes part of a network instead of an isolated file."

Your field might be too new, too interdisciplinary, or too specialized for formal standards to have emerged.\nBut I guarantee there are data sharing champions in your field - researchers who consistently publish well-organized, thoroughly documented datasets. They might not call themselves standards developers, but they’re solving the same problems you are, and they’re probably solving them thoughtfully.\nFind these researchers. Look at how they organize their data, what they document, how they describe their methods. You don’t have to reinvent every wheel - you can build on their solutions.\nAnd here’s the exciting part: when you adopt and refine these approaches, you’re potentially contributing to the development of future standards for your field. Today’s informal best practices become tomorrow’s established standards. The researchers who developed BIDS started exactly this way - as individual labs sharing data in thoughtful ways, eventually realizing they could create something bigger together.\nYour contribution to developing standards might be as simple as documenting and sharing your own data management approach. Sometimes that’s all it takes to start a conversation that grows into community-wide adoption."

How do communities benefit?”\nEssential for Indigenous data and community-centered research\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve talked about community standards and adopting existing practices, it’s important to address another framework that’s increasingly essential in research data management: the CARE principles. While FAIR principles focus on making data technically accessible and reusable, CARE principles—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—ensure that data use serves the communities it represents, especially Indigenous communities and other marginalized groups.\nCARE principles are particularly crucial when working with Indigenous data, cultural heritage information, or any data that represents community knowledge. They emphasize that communities should have authority over how their data is collected, used, and shared. This isn’t just about consent—it’s about ongoing relationships, reciprocity, and ensuring that research benefits the communities involved, not just the researchers.\nThink of CARE as the ethical complement to FAIR. Where FAIR asks “Can people access and use this data?”, CARE asks “Should they?” and “How do we ensure the community benefits?” This is especially relevant as we move toward data sharing—it’s not enough to make data technically accessible if we haven’t considered the ethical implications and community impact.\nFor most of you, this might mean ensuring your consent processes include discussions about long-term data use, checking whether your research benefits the communities you study, and being mindful of power dynamics in data ownership. Even if you’re not working directly with Indigenous communities, CARE principles offer valuable guidance for responsible, community-centered research practices."

DOI identifies what you created—this answers the metadata question “What do the data files contain?” ORCID answers “Who created the dataset?” and follows you across institutions. RRID answers “How was the dataset generated?” by identifying specific materials. ROR identifies where the work happened. You don’t need all four immediately—DOI for your data and ORCID for yourself covers most of what you need. This connects back to our proper metadata discussion. PIDs essentially formalize the key metadata questions in a standardized, machine-readable way. Instead of just writing “John Smith created this,” you use an ORCID that uniquely identifies John Smith forever. Instead of a description that might be ambiguous, you have a DOI that points to the exact dataset. This is how we move from human-readable to machine-actionable metadata."
